# Closest Points
Algorithm to find the closest pair of points in xy-plane.
In here you can find two different algorithms used to find two closest point if given n points.
BruteForce.cpp is O(n^2) and Divide&Conquer.cpp is O(nlogn), while in Compare.cpp you can find both algorithms and code to compare time needed to find the closest pair of points.
